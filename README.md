 # slow-death-of-rent
 
 A project to show how the need for rent could be removed from society over a time period
 
 
 Perspectives:
 - 1 person as they move from one rental house to another building equity.
 - a single property owner as they rent until they hit a force sale
  - what happens on a force sale
 - a pension fund as it divests from property over 100 years
